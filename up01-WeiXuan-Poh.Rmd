[*Original recipe here*](https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/grilled-skirt-steak-potatoes-herb-sauce)

##**Ingredients**  
> * 2 cups fresh flat-leaf parsley
> * 1/4 cup fresh oregano
> * 2 cloves garlic
> * 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
> * 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
> * 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
> * 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
> * 1 1/2 pounds skirt steak
> * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
> * 1 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes, cut on the diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick slices

##**Instructions**
> 1. Heat grill to medium
> 2. Pulse the parsley, oregano, and garlic in a food processor until roughly chopped. Add the vinegar, oil, cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon salt; pulse to combine. Set aside.
> 3. Season the steak with the remaining salt and the pepper. Grill to desired doneness, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 5 minutes before slicing.
> 4. Meanwhile, toss the potatoes in a large bowl with 1/3 cup of the herb sauce.
> 5. Place the potatoes on the grill in a single layer. Cook, turning once, until tender, about 4  minutes per side.
> 6. Divide the steak and potatoes among plates and serve with the remaining herb sauce on the side.

#**Quadratic Equation**
  
The quadratic equation is listed as any equation having the form 
$$ax^2+bx+c=0$$

where *x* represents an unknown, and *a*, *b*, and *c* represent known numbers such that *a* is not equal to 0. If *a* = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The numbers *a*, *b*, and *c* are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.
  
To derive the roots, or *x* of the general quadratic equation, the formula
$$x=\frac{-b {\pm} \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
applies, with *a*, *b* and *c* being the coefficients of the general quadratic equation.
  
#**Reflections and Thoughts**
I think the most difficult aspect was discovering things we did not know about already - such as finding out how to code R commands to properly display the equations.  
I took about an hour and a half to two hours for this homework, and found the most time consuming portion to be just stringing and bring the entire code together.  
This was the first time I was using markdown and so far, it has been quite intuitive.
